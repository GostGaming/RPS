Game Programming Final Project

Language: C#
Engine: Unity3D

R>P>S Is a rock-paper-scissors style RTS game built in Unity. My goal is to eventually expand upon the game to be a micromanagement focused RTS inspired by games such as the Warcraft and Call of Duty franchises.
At the moment the game is very simple: Build rock, paper, or scissors units to defend against a rutheless enemy AI who will be sending random units every few seconds. You and the computer each have harvesters who you must defend in order to continue building units. Once your core buildings are destroyed, the game is over. 
Controls are listed in the Pause Menu (esc).
